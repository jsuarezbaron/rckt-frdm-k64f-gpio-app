# GPIO output on the Freedom K64F board

This application demonstrates GPIO input and output on the Freedom K64F board.
The on-board RGB LED cycles through color combinations and reads the state of switch SW3.

The application sets the on-board RGB LED to display its color combinations.
While switch SW3 is pressed, the LED will not change the LED color.

## Sample Output

The application's serial output confirms the GPIO pin configuration and describes the color combination shown on the RGB LED, such as:

```
Pin 4 of GPIO Port A configured
Pin 22 of GPIO Port B configured
Pin 21 of GPIO Port B configured
Pin 26 of GPIO Port E configured
LED is OFF
LED is Red
LED is Blue
LED is Green
LED is Red+Blue
LED is Red+Green
LED is Blue+Green
LED is Red+Blue+Green
LED is OFF
```
The current LED color combination is continually updated.
